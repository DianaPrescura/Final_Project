Individual Self Assessment


This self - assessment’s main purpose is to describe the role that I have played in the bootcamp’s final task, or better said the final project. I have to say that it has been a challenging project, each member being given a different  segment to complete. For example, when it was time for the tasks distribution, I volunteered to take care of the Data Description. In addition, I was made responsible for rendering the visualization of the sales data, using Tableau. I was able to create an interactive and a dynamic visualization that helped the team to communicate the key findings and insights from the data analysis and the predictive modeling. It was a continuous collaboration with the other members of the team, in order to establish the most important insight to communicate and the best way to display them. Furthermore, I have created a dashboard and a story, this way allowing us to provide a more comprehensive overview of the data  analysis and predicting results.

The project’s name is Sales Analysis and it has been structured in a way that would help us answer the question whether there is a correlation between customer buying behavior and the company revenue. The topic was selected by group consensus, analyzing the sales, being an interesting  and actual field where it could be projected as an analysis.    
 The goal of this project is to analyze e-commerce sales data using various analytical techniques and tools to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and revenue generation. Furthermore, the insights gained from this project will help the online businesses identify their top-performing products, target their marketing efforts more effectively, and optimize their sales strategies to increase revenue and customer satisfaction

Methodology 
*Data Exploration: Explore the customer orders and sales data to identify any patterns, trends, or outliers that may be useful for analysis using Python and SQL.
*Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing or invalid values, converting data types, and merging tables as needed using Python and SQL.
*Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis and perform statistical analysis to identify key insights and trends in the data using Python and SQL.
*Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models using regression, clustering, and other machine learning techniques to forecast future sales, customer churn, and customer lifetime value using Python and SQL.
Visualization: Use Tableau to create interactive and dynamic visualizations that effectively communicate key findings and insights from the data analysis and predictive modeling.
Reporting: Compile a comprehensive report summarizing the data analysis and predictive modeling results, including key insights, conclusions, and recommendations for future actions.

Summary
Significant variables that help to target marketing efforts and predict sales: Age Gender Price Product Type State

Older customers tend to buy more expensive products than younger customers.

Older customers tend to buy more quantity of products than younger customers.

As the gender of a buyer becomes more male-dominated, the quantity of products purchased tends to decrease slightly.

As the customers' age increases, the likelihood of them buying trousers also increases slightly.

As the customers' age increases, the likelihood of them buying jackets decreases slightly.

Problems Found/Limitations
We could not detect seasonality in this data set (i.e., whether there are certain months of the year when sales are consistently higher or lower). The seasonal_decompose function requires at least two full seasonal cycles to properly decompose the time series. Since we use monthly data, a seasonal cycle would be 12 months, so we would need at least 24 months of data. In this case, we only have 10 months of data, which is not enough to perform the seasonal decomposition. Therefore, we cannot analyze the seasonality of the sales data with this particular dataset. We would need to gather more data over a longer period of time to perform this analysis.

Future Analysis/Recommendations
Collect data over a longer period of time (24 months) to be able to analyze seasonality in the sales data.

Collect data at a higher frequency, such as weekly or daily, to better capture any shorter-term patterns or trends in sales. This could provide more insight into the seasonality of the sales data and help inform future business decisions.
